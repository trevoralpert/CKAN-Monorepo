<h2><a href="./data-gov-uk/">Data.gov.uk</a></h2>

<p>Data.Gov.UK is the UK Government’s official open data portal. The site provides a central “way into the wealth of government data” and aims to make that data “easy to find; easy to license; and easy to re-use.” Data.Gov.UK was launched in closed Beta at the start of October 2009 and entered public beta in January 2010.</p>

<p>Data.Gov.UK has been built on a combination of CKAN and Drupal, the open-source CMS. The Open Knowledge Foundation’s CKAN team have been involved in the development of Data.Gov.UK from its inception. The team helped developed the prototype for the closed beta launch and have been involved in developing and maintaining the project, especially the CKAN aspect, since that point.</p>

<h2><a href="./publicdata-eu/">PublicData.eu</a></h2>

<p>PublicData.eu is a research prototype of a pan-European data catalogue and federation mechanism, developed as part of the FP7-funded LOD2 project. Running on CKAN, the site is developed as a use case and an early adopter of the LOD2 linked data stack technologies. After the LOD2 project’s launch in September 2010, a first version of the site was released in June 2011.</p>

<p>The portal’s backend uses CKANs harvesting framework to retrieve, normalize and convert dataset metadata from 25 catalogues across Europe, including national and regional as well as official and community-driven efforts.</p>
