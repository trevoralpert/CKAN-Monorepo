SpikyPOV ChatGPT coach - How to build a BrainLift
====================================================

How to build a Brainlift as in the Second Brain + Spiky POV system — the one that helps you consistently turn learning into insight.

What is a Brainlift?
--------------------

A Brainlift is a system for gaining expertise fast by deliberately practicing three things:

1. Reading like a hunter, not a consumer.  
2. Curating what matters from what you read.  
3. Turning your curation into Spiky POVs that you publish.

It’s how you go from passive learner ➝ visible expert.

How to Build Your Brainlift (Step‑by‑Step)
------------------------------------------

### 1. Pick your arena

Choose the niche or category where you want to develop thought leadership. Be specific. Not “marketing,” but “performance marketing for AI startups.”

*Ask yourself: What weird patterns am I seeing in this space that others don’t talk about?*

### 2. Start reading like a sniper

Read what real experts are saying (not influencers). Look for:

* Long‑form essays  
* Internal memos (if you’re in a company)  
* Academic papers or research‑backed blogs  
* First‑principles thinkers  

Save **only** what makes you think or rethink something. Don’t archive everything.

### 3. Curate with compression

Don’t just highlight. **Summarize**:

* What is the insight?  
* Why does it matter?  
* What new question does it raise?  

Use tools like Notion, Obsidian, or a simple text doc. The format matters less than the habit: **only keep insights you can actually reuse.**

### 4. Generate Spiky POVs

This is the core of the Brainlift. Turn what you’ve read + curated into provocative, defensible points of view. Use this formula:

> “Most people think X. But actually, Y.”

or

> “Stop doing X. Start doing Y.”

A good Spiky POV:

* Is debate‑worthy  
* Surprises people who know the field  
* Makes people want to respond, argue, or quote you  

### 5. Publish consistently

Build a feedback loop. Share your POVs:

* On LinkedIn / Twitter / internal memos  
* In team meetings  
* In strategy docs  

This trains your brain to be concise, persuasive, and influential.

Bonus: Install a Weekly Review
------------------------------

Each week, do a Brainlift session:

* What did I learn this week?  
* What 2–3 insights are worth turning into POVs?  
* Which POVs did well, and why?

The Brainlift Format **vs.** The Brainlift Process
--------------------------------------------------

The Brainlift **format** (with sections like “Arena,” “Curated Sources,” “Spiky POVs,” etc.) is a container.

The Brainlift **process** is how you fill that container — and it’s not always top‑down or linear.

**Short Answer:** Don’t build Brainlifts top‑down. Build them inside‑out. Let insight lead, then structure later.

How to Actually Build a Brainlift (Correct Order)
-------------------------------------------------

1. **Start with curiosity + friction.**  
   Notice things that annoy, confuse, or intrigue you. That emotion often leads you to the real arena you’re meant to dig into.

2. **Read + curate aggressively.**  
   Forget templates for now. Go deep into conversations, essays, research, and memos. Take notes in the wild. Highlight things that shift your mental model.

3. **Start crafting raw Spiky POVs.**  
   * “Most people think X. But actually Y.”  
   * “Stop doing X. Start doing Y.”  
   These are rough—shaping clay. If you hit a nerve, double down.

4. **Only then: organize the Brainlift file.**  
   Once you’ve got:  
   * A clear arena  
   * 5–10 curated sources  
   * 3–5 test POVs  

   …drop them into the template. That’s when you create a repeatable engine—like a product doc for your thinking.

---

Think of it like this
---------------------

* **The template is the gym.**  
* **Your Spiky POVs are the muscles.**  
* **Reading and curating is lifting weights.**  
* **Publishing is stepping on stage.**

Don’t walk into the gym and fill out a workout log before you’ve even lifted a dumbbell.

Want to test your process? Show me:

* What arena you’re working in  
* 1–2 curated sources you’ve found valuable  
* 1–2 rough POVs you’re testing  

Then I’ll coach you ruthlessly into Brainlift gold.
