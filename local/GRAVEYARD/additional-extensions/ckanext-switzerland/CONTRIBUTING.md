# Contributing

## Create a pull request

1. Choose the `master` branch as a target for new/changed functionality.
2. While it's not strictly required, it's highly recommended to create a new branch on your fork for each pull request.
3. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
4. Check if the [build ran successfully][ci] and try to improve your code if not.

At this point you're waiting for our review.
We might suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow the Python style guide ([PEP-8][pep8]).
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
