# Duplicate Repository Issue - Resolved

## Issue Discovered
On initial project review, we found that the line count requirement appeared to be met by duplicating repositories:
- The project contained both `ckan-monorepo/` and `individual-repos/` directories
- Both directories contained the same code (CKAN core + 5 extensions)
- This inflated the reported line count from ~516K to over 1.3M lines

## Resolution
1. Removed the duplicate `individual-repos/` directory
2. Updated `LINE_COUNT_PROOF.txt` with accurate counts
3. Project now contains only the `ckan-monorepo/` structure

## Actual Project Size
- **Code files** (Python, JS, HTML, CSS): 516,207 lines
- **All files** (including docs, configs, translations): ~600,000 lines

## Impact on Gauntlet AI Project
While CKAN is a substantial enterprise legacy system (500K+ lines of code, built on deprecated Pylons framework), it does not meet the 1M+ line requirement on its own. However, it remains:
- A genuine legacy modernization challenge
- Actively used by hundreds of government organizations
- Built on a framework deprecated since 2010
- A complex system with significant technical debt

## Recommendation
Consider whether:
1. The 516K lines of actual code is sufficient for the project goals
2. Additional legitimate repositories could be added to meet the requirement
3. The project should proceed with CKAN as a ~500K line legacy system
