        <title>#2582: Do not hide notes / readme on dataset pages</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Current we hide most of readme and then let users reveal it. Stop doing this and if necessary add a quick link down to resources section. (Maybe also rename resources to Data and Resources ...?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Aside: believe I have mentioned this somewhere a month + ago but could not find the ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#2766: prevent draft datasets making it to activity stream</title>
        <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2012 16:06:35 GMT</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
The new ckan creates datasets as part of a 3 phase process.  To allow for this partially created datasets can have a state that is 'draft' or 'draft-complete'.  These datasets should not be seen as active by the activity stream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we click 'add dataset' and then complete the first phase of adding a dataset then we end up having a activity stream created.  When we add a resource in the next phase (add data) again an activity stream item xxx added resource to dataset is created
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We do not want these adding.  Essentially if a dataset has a state.startswith('draft') then we want the activity stream to ignore all actions involving it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
finally when the state is changed form state.startswith('draft') to state=='active' we want a xxx has created dataset ... to be added to the stream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The best way to do this would be to branch from 2375-demo-theme-stable and get it to work there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let me know if you need any help with this ticket or a better explanation of the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#2859: Fix the build</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
The requires files have been removed.  These were required by buildkit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We've lost the information regarding which packages were already in ubuntu repos, which conflicted and which were missing.  But perhaps we can just package everything up.
&lt;/p&gt;
