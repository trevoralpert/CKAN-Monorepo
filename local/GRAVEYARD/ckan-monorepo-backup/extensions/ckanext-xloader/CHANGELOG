CHANGELOG
=========
See: https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-xloader/releases if this file has drifted.

2.0.1 2025-03-04
================

## Fix

* #244 Static webassets not included in package
* #245 support apitoken_header_name in 2.11.x.
* #241 loading R/W datasource resources via api (not hardcoded)

2.0.0 2024-12-10
================

## Major
Dropped CKAN 2.9.x and Python2.


## Feat:
* Adds Strip White Space fields to the Data Dictionary (defualts to `True` for each field).
  This will strip surrounding white space from data values prior to inserting them into the database.
* Adds support for ckanext-validation. Config `ckanext.xloader.validation.requires_successful_report`
  controls whether a resource requires a successful validation report to be XLoadered.
  By default, a resource would also require a Validation Schema, which can be turned off with
  `ckanext.xloader.validation.enforce_schema`.
