# Enterprise Legacy Modernization Project

## Introduction
When you enter the professional software development world, you won't be building applications from scratch on green‑field projects. Instead, you'll inherit massive, complex legacy codebases that have been “duct‑taped together” over decades—systems with millions of lines of code written in older versions of Java, COBOL, Python, or C that somehow keep entire businesses running.

These enterprise systems represent the reality of software development: proven business logic wrapped in outdated technology stacks, sprawling architectures that evolved organically, and critical functionality buried in code that nobody fully understands anymore. **Your ability to quickly comprehend these systems and modernize them effectively will determine your career trajectory.**

This project simulates that exact scenario. You'll take a real open‑source codebase **with over 1,000,000 lines of legacy code** and use AI‑assisted development tools—like Cursor and Claude Code—to not just understand it, but to completely modernize and relaunch it for a new target market.

## Core Challenge
> Select a large‑scale legacy open‑source codebase (1 M+ lines), identify a specific target user segment that could benefit from a modernized version, then use AI‑assisted development to create a completely relaunch‑ready application that preserves the core business logic while delivering a modern user experience and architecture.

**Success means:** shipping a working, modernized application that demonstrates both deep understanding of the legacy system *and* the ability to transform complex codebases using AI assistance.

## Project Pathways

| Path | Legacy Codebase | Why these systems matter | Modernization Opportunities |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **1. Enterprise CRM Modernization** | SugarCRM CE (2.3 M LOC, PHP 7.4) or SuiteCRM (1.8 M LOC, PHP) | Sophisticated CRM logic, complex workflows, custom fields, integrations. | * Mobile‑first architecture for field sales<br>* Industry‑specific customizations (healthcare, real‑estate, manufacturing)<br>* API‑first micro‑services<br>* AI‑powered lead scoring & insights |
| **2. Office‑Suite Platform Transformation** | Apache OpenOffice (8 M+ LOC, C++) or LibreOffice (10 M+ LOC, C++) | Decades of document‑format expertise, cross‑platform, feature‑rich editors. | * Cloud‑native collaborative editing<br>* Mobile editing workflows<br>* Industry document templates & automation<br>* Cloud‑storage integration |
| **3. Legacy Python Web‑Platform Evolution** | Plone CMS (1.1 M LOC, Python 2.7/3.6) or legacy Django apps (Django 1.x/2.x) | Years of web‑app patterns, user management, content workflows, integrations. | * Python 3.11+ migration with `async`/`await`<br>* Docker/Kubernetes deployment<br>* API‑first architecture replacing monolith<br>* Modern frontend frameworks |
| **4. Deprecated Python Framework Revival** | Pylons, TurboGears 1.x, or Zope 2.x apps | Representative of 10–15‑year‑old enterprise Python still in production. | * Migrate to Flask/FastAPI/Django<br>* ORM modernization (SQLAlchemy 2.x)<br>* Modern auth & security<br>* Cloud‑native deployment |

## Target User Selection

After choosing your pathway, identify a **specific target user segment** that represents a modernization opportunity.

### Example Target Segments

1. **SugarCRM → Real‑Estate CRM**  
   *Agents need mobile‑first property management with modern UX.*

2. **OpenOffice → Educational Document Platform**  
   *Teachers need collaborative lesson planning with cloud integration.*

3. **Trac → Startup Project Management**  
   *Small tech teams want simple, fast issue tracking without enterprise bloat.*

4. **Alfresco → SMB Workflow**  
   *Small businesses need document‑approval workflows minus the enterprise overhead.*

**Requirements:**

* Represents a legitimate market opportunity that benefits from the legacy system’s core functionality.  
* Highlights specific pain‑points that modern tech can solve.  
* Narrow enough to finish in 7 days, broad enough to demonstrate meaningful modernization.
