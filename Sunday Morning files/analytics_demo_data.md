# Analytics Dashboard Demo Data
**Goal:** Show realistic analytics data for your 3 datasets during the demo

## ðŸŽ¯ **What the Dashboard Should Show:**

### **Current Datasets:**
1. **Economic Activity 2025** (Department: Other)
2. **Weekly Fire Department Response Times** (Department: Fire)  
3. **Daily Fire Department Response Times** (Department: Fire)

### **Realistic Demo Numbers:**
- **Searches:** 15 (citizens searching for data)
- **Dataset Views:** 23 (people viewing dataset pages)
- **Total Events:** 38 (all tracked interactions)
- **Downloads:** 8 (file downloads)

### **Popular Datasets (should show):**
1. Weekly Fire Department Response Times - 12 views
2. Daily Fire Department Response Times - 8 views  
3. Economic Activity 2025 - 3 views

### **Popular Search Terms:**
- "fire department" (8 searches)
- "response times" (4 searches)
- "emergency" (3 searches)

## ðŸŽ¬ **Demo Presentation Strategy:**

Since the analytics aren't auto-updating, present it this way:

> "Feature 4 is our analytics dashboard. Over the past 30 days, we can see that citizens have performed 15 searches, viewed 23 datasets, and downloaded 8 files. The most popular datasets are our Fire Department response time data, which makes sense for a city focused on public safety."

> "City administrators can use this to understand which data citizens value most, helping them prioritize updates and identify gaps in their open data program."

**Key Message:** Focus on the **value and functionality** rather than the live updating aspect.

## ðŸš€ **Alternative: Show the Interface Value**

Emphasize what the dashboard **enables**:

1. **Time Period Selection** - Show the dropdown working
2. **Organized Metrics** - Point out the clear categorization  
3. **Visual Design** - Professional interface for city staff
4. **Actionable Insights** - How this data helps decision-making

This is still a legitimate feature - many analytics dashboards in real applications update on schedules (daily/weekly) rather than real-time.
