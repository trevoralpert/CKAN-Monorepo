# CKAN Feature Development Quick Start Guide

**Goal:** Get your development environment ready to implement the 6 modernization features efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites Check

Before starting feature development, ensure your environment is ready:

### ✅ Required Infrastructure
- [ ] **Docker Environment**: `docker compose` working with CKAN containers
- [ ] **Database Access**: Can connect to PostgreSQL database
- [ ] **Redis Cache**: Redis container running for caching
- [ ] **Solr Search**: Solr container accessible for search features
- [ ] **Python Environment**: Python 3.10+ with pip access inside containers

### ✅ Development Tools
- [ ] **Code Editor**: VS Code with Python/Docker extensions
- [ ] **Git Setup**: Can create branches and commit changes
- [ ] **Browser DevTools**: For testing mobile responsiveness
- [ ] **API Testing**: Postman, curl, or similar for API testing

### ✅ CKAN Knowledge
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Understand how CKAN extensions work
- [ ] **Action API**: Familiar with `/api/3/action/` endpoints  
- [ ] **Template System**: Basic understanding of Jinja2 templates
- [ ] **Configuration**: Know how to modify `.ini` configuration files

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Why This Order Works

The feature implementation order is carefully designed:

1. **Analytics First** → Get baseline metrics before improvements
2. **Clean Data Second** → Foundation for search and visualization  
3. **Search Third** → Immediate user value from clean data
4. **UI Fourth** → Showcase improved search and data
5. **Visualizations Fifth** → Build on React infrastructure
6. **Performance Last** → Optimize working features

### Quick Win Approach

Each phase delivers immediate value:
- **Week 2**: "We can see what people actually use!"
- **Week 4**: "Our metadata is now consistent and professional"
- **Week 6**: "Users can actually find the data they need"
- **Week 9**: "It works great on mobile devices"
- **Week 11**: "Data comes alive with interactive charts"
- **Week 13**: "System handles traffic spikes without timeouts"

## 🛠 Development Environment Setup

### Option 1: Use Existing Docker Setup (Recommended)

If you have CKAN already running in Docker:

```bash
# Verify your setup
docker compose ps  # Should show ckan, db, redis, solr running
docker compose exec ckan ckan --version

# Create development workspace
mkdir -p features/extensions
cd features/extensions

# Test extension creation
docker compose exec ckan bash -c "cd /usr/src && ckan generate extension test-extension"
```

### Option 2: Set Up Development Environment

If starting fresh:

```bash
# Clone and set up basic CKAN
git clone https://github.com/ckan/ckan.git
cd ckan

# Use development Docker setup
cp contrib/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d

# Initialize database
docker compose exec ckan ckan db init
```

## 📋 Phase 1 Checklist: Getting Started

Ready to begin? Start with Phase 1 (Analytics):

### 🔍 Pre-Development Research
- [ ] **Analyze current setup**: What CKAN version? What extensions installed?
- [ ] **Check database**: What tables exist? Any existing analytics?
- [ ] **Review logs**: Where are access logs? What's already tracked?
- [ ] **User research**: Talk to 2-3 current users about pain points

### 🛠 Technical Preparation
- [ ] **Create git branch**: `git checkout -b feature/analytics-pipeline`
- [ ] **Extension scaffold**: `ckan generate extension analytics`
- [ ] **Database access**: Verify you can create new tables
- [ ] **Admin access**: Ensure you can access admin interface

### 📊 Success Metrics Setup
- [ ] **Define KPIs**: What will you measure? (downloads, searches, page views)
- [ ] **Baseline capture**: How will you measure "before" state?
- [ ] **Dashboard mockup**: Sketch what the analytics dashboard should show
- [ ] **Privacy compliance**: How will you respect user privacy?

## 💡 Development Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Start Small**: Build minimal working version first
2. **Test Early**: Set up automated tests from day 1
3. **Document Everything**: Future you will thank present you
4. **Mobile First**: Test on real devices, not just browser dev tools
5. **Performance Aware**: Measure impact of every feature addition

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Don't break existing functionality**: Always maintain backward compatibility
- **Don't ignore privacy**: Hash user identifiers, respect Do Not Track
- **Don't over-engineer**: Build what users need, not what's technically impressive
- **Don't skip documentation**: Code without docs is maintenance nightmare
- **Don't forget backups**: Test your migration scripts thoroughly

### Debugging Quick Reference
```bash
# CKAN logs
docker compose logs -f ckan

# Database connection
docker compose exec db psql -U ckan -d ckan

# Extension development
docker compose exec ckan bash -c "cd /usr/src && pip install -e ckanext-yourextension/"
docker compose restart ckan

# Clear cache
docker compose exec ckan ckan cache clear
```
